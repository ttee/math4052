# Sound Files

This directory should contain the following sound files:
- `correct.mp3` - Sound played when answer is correct
- `wrong.mp3` - Sound played when answer is wrong

You can add your own sound files or disable sound functionality by commenting out the `playSound` function calls in the Quiz components.
